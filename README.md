# RISC-Assembler-and-Simulator

Description:

This repository contains the source code for a custom-built assembler and simulator designed for the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specified in the provided ISA sheet. This toolset, developed for a CSE 112 Computer Organization course project, offers the following functionalities:

Assembly: Reads assembly instructions from a text file named "Instructions.txt".
Error Checking: Thoroughly analyzes the input instructions for potential errors and prints detailed error messages if any are found.
Simulation: If the input is free of errors, the assembler generates the corresponding binary encoding for each instruction.
ISA Compatibility: Handles all valid instruction types defined in the provided ISA sheet.
Verification: The generated binary encodings have been extensively verified against the provided ISA sheet to ensure accuracy.
